# Plotting Important Goals in Liverpool's 2018/19 Champions League Run

This project is an extension of a positional data analysis done by the Friends of Tracking initiative, which can be found at https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/Last-Row.

In this project we hand-pick certain goals scored in in Liverpool's 2018/19 Champions League run.
We use voronoi diagrams to divide the spaces on the pitch in to zones. Each playerâ€™s zone is the area of the pitch that is closer to that player than to any other. In other words, it is the area of the pitch they control at a specific moment.

The dataset used here is ``liverpool_2019.csv``, which contains 19 goals scored by Livepool FC in 2019.

Columns included:
* ``play``: the scoreline after the goal. The team who scored the goal is the one next to the brackets.
* ``frame``: the frame number for the current location. Data provided has 20 frames per second.
* ``player``: the id of the player. The id is consistent within a play but **not between plays**.
* ``player_num``: the player jersey number. This number is the official one, and did not change for Liverpool in 2019.
* ``x``, ``y``: coordinates for the player/ball. Pitch coordinates go from 0 to 100 on each axis.
* ``dx``, ``dx``: change in (x,y) coordinates from last frame to current frame
* ``z``: height, from 0 to 1.5 (only filled for the ball)
* ``bgcolor``: the main color for the team (used as background color)
* ``edgecolor`` the secondary color (used as edge color)
